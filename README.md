S.H.Ho College Commual Dining Registration Extension for Chrome
===========================================================

## Usage

 - Install the extension.
 - Go to S.H.Ho dining registration page.
 - Click the icon appeard on the left side of the address bar.
 - Select dinings you want to register.
 - Click **_Register_** button.
 - Do nothing but wait. _(It may take a very long time)_
 - Done when a popup message shows up.
 - Go to next page and do the same thing.

## Notice

 - Not able to register items from different pages. 
 - If you accidently closed the tab, re-open it and everything will continue automatically.
 - Never close chrome when processing.
 - It should work for other registration pages on ITSC WRS system if you slightly change the codes.

## Features

 - Actually you can browse in other tabs while registering.
 - Need not to care about ever-registered dinings. We can detect them.
 - Skip the confirmation window. _(Brilliant idea from https://www.dropbox.com/s/quq4je5p0t5yyhs/reg.js?dl=0. Many thanks to the author.)_
